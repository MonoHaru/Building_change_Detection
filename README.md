# Building_change_Detection
 We propose a computing system to detect building change.

# Abstract
We built a computing system using existing benchmark models to detect building change.

The experiment was successfully completed.

# What to improve
The experiment always showed an iou with a lower 3 label value.

Various experiments were conducted to improve this problem, but as soon as the iou of the 3 label was increased, the other iou was lowered.

Although the overall preformance was high, this became one of the reamining challenges.
